npm i

stencil ci does not work with a newer version of node
need to revert node v to 8 >= version < 11.0.0

### runnig app - must run these stencil init, and stencil start inside of corner stone dir

stencil start may not work do the bad/ill-maintianed dependencies

delete node_modules and npm update if itwill not start

to push remove inner gitignore and move its content to outer gitignore

    - this is done because stencil cli is not globally installed

stencil start will spin the app up
provide api key/oauth access token
